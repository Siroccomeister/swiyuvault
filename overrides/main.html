{% extends "base.html" %}

{#
  This is the base template override for all pages.
  
  For page-specific JavaScript and configuration:
  - Use custom templates (e.g., demo-issuer.html, demo-verifier.html)
  - Reference them in page front matter: template: demo-issuer.html
  
  Global customizations that apply to ALL pages can be added here.
